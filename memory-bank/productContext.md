# Product Context: Python Readability

## Why This Project Exists
Python Readability exists to provide Python developers with a robust solution for extracting the main content from web pages. While the original `go-readability` library offers this functionality in Go, there's a need for a high-quality equivalent in the Python ecosystem.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Content Extraction**: Extracts the main article content from web pages, removing navigation, ads, footers, and other irrelevant elements.
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Identifies and extracts key metadata like title, author, publication date, and featured image.
3. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Enables Python developers to use the same high-quality content extraction algorithm available in Go.
4. **Web Scraping Challenges**: Addresses the complexity of parsing and extracting meaningful content from diverse web page structures.

## How It Should Work
1. **Input**: Accept HTML content (as string or bytes) and optionally a URL for context.
2. **Processing**: Apply a series of preprocessing, scoring, extraction, and cleaning steps:
   - Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup/lxml
   - Preprocess the document (remove scripts, styles, etc.)
   - Extract metadata (title, author, date, etc.)
   - Score content nodes based on various heuristics
   - Identify and extract the main content
   - Clean and post-process the extracted content
3. **Output**: Return an Article object containing:
   - Extracted content (HTML)
   - Plain text version
   - Metadata (title, author, date, etc.)
   - Error information if extraction failed

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Provide a clean, intuitive API that's easy to use
2. **Reliability**: Consistently extract the main content across diverse web pages
3. **Flexibility**: Support various input formats and configuration options
4. **Performance**: Efficiently process HTML content with minimal overhead
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain behavior compatibility with the original Go implementation
6. **Pythonic**: Follow Python conventions and best practices

## Target Users
