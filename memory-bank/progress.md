# Progress Report for Python Readability

## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **HTML Parsing**: The library can parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup with the lxml parser.
2. **Content Extraction**: The library can extract the main content from HTML pages.
3. **Metadata Extraction**: The library can extract metadata such as title, author, and publication date from HTML pages.
4. **URL Handling**: The library can handle relative URLs and convert them to absolute URLs.
5. **Visibility Detection**: The library can detect and exclude hidden elements.

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **Test Case Discovery**: The test infrastructure can automatically discover test cases in the `tests/test-pages` directory.
2. **Test Case Execution**: The test infrastructure can execute test cases and compare the output with the expected output.
3. **Test Case Categorization**: The test infrastructure supports categorizing test cases by functional area, criticality level, and test type.
4. **Test Case Verification**: The test infrastructure includes a script to verify that all test cases are properly implemented and categorized.

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

1. **CLI Tool**: The command-line interface for the library still needs to be implemented.
2. **Packaging**: The library needs to be packaged for distribution on PyPI.

### Test Cases

1. **Create New Test Cases**: New test cases need to be created to fill identified gaps in test coverage.

### Documentation

1. **API Documentation**: The API documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest changes.

### Completed Documentation

1. **README.md**: Created a comprehensive README with project overview, installation instructions, usage examples, testing approach, and development setup.
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Created detailed guidelines for contributors covering code style, test case addition, and pull request process.

## Current Status

The project is in the testing and refinement phase. The core functionality is implemented and working, and all test cases from the Go implementation have been successfully migrated and are passing. The test infrastructure has been enhanced to support categorization and prioritization, which will help guide the remaining work on creating new test cases and implementing the CLI tool.

## Known Issues

### 1. DOM Traversal Mapping

There might be some inconsistencies in how we map Go's DOM traversal methods to BeautifulSoup's methods. This could lead to differences in behavior between the Go and Python implementations. We need to carefully review and test this mapping.

### 2. Regular Expression Translation

Some of the regular expressions from the Go implementation might not have been translated correctly to Python's re syntax. This could lead to differences in behavior between the Go and Python implementations. We need to carefully review and test these translations.

### 3. Performance Optimization

The Python implementation is likely slower than the Go implementation due to the nature of the languages. We need to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

## Next Steps

1. **Create new test cases**: Create new test cases to fill identified gaps in test coverage.
2. **Update API documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings to all public functions, classes, and methods.
3. **Implement CLI tool**: Implement the command-line interface for the library.
4. **Package for distribution**: Package the library for distribution on PyPI.
